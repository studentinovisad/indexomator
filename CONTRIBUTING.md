## Open a New Issue

### If it's Security-Related

Please review our [Security Policy](https://github.com/studentinovisad/indexomator/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Fix an Existing Issue

Browse through the [Open Issues](https://github.com/studentinovisad/indexomator/issues) and pick one that interests you. After selecting an issue, leave a comment on it or reach out via our communication channels, and we'll assign it to you.

### Branch Creation

If you'd like to create your own branch to fix an issue, feel free to do so. Contact us so that you can create branches.

When creating a branch, please make sure to follow our branch naming convention. This helps keep things organized and makes it easier for everyone to collaborate. **The branch name format should be**: `{initials}/{feat/fix}/{branch-name}`.

- `{initials}`: Use your initials or a really short nick to identify your work;
- `{feat/fix/chore}`: Specify whether the branch is for a new feature (feat), a bug fix (fix) or something not code-related (chore);
- `{branch-name}`: Give the branch a descriptive name related to the task you're working on (e.g., user-authentication, login-bug);
- `/` **separator**: Be sure to include a `/` between these sections.

This structure helps ensure that branches are **clear**, **consistent**, and **easy to navigate**.

_Before committing, ask the project administration if there are any commit name notation rules._
